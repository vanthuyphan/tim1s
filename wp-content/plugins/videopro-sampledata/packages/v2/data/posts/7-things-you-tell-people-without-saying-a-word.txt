I actually made it three or four years before I ended up homeless, but I exhausted every single resource I had over those four years. Then, at the end of it, you have nothing. By the end I had to sell all of my tools to survive, because they were just sitting there, they weren’t earning any income, so I had to sell them.

My kids and my wife were resentful. They thought I did something wrong. My wife, she says, What happened? She didn’t know. She’d never had to work, and I kind of took care of everything. She really didn’t understand the business — all she knew was that I got up every morning and went to work somewhere

Welcome to the website of the Cafe on the Corner. We are situated, yes you’ve guessed it, on the corner of This Road and That Street in The Town.

We serve freshly brewed tea and coffee, soft drinks and a section of light meals and tasty treats and snacks. We are open for breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea from 8am to 5pm and unlike any other cafe in the town, we are open 7 days per week.

A truly family run business, we aim to create a cosy and friendly atmosphere in the cafe with Mum and Auntie doing the cooking and Dad and the (grown-up) children serving front of house. We look forward to welcoming you to the Cafe on the Corner very soon.

We work with clients big and small across a range of sectors and we utilise all forms of media to get your name out there in a way that’s right for you. We believe that analysis of your company and your customers is key in responding effectively to your promotional needs and we will work with you to fully understand your business to achieve the greatest amount of publicity possible so that you can see a return from the advertising.

We are a friendly team of dentists, hygienists and receptionists who work together to ensure that you receive the best treatment that you require at a time that suits you. All of our dentists are accredited by The British Dental Association Good Practice Scheme, so you can rest assured that your smile really is in good hands.

We offer NHS dental treatment to children and have a very easy private payment scheme for our adult patients. We encourage everyone to visit the dentist regularly so that we can prevent any problems from occurring and the more you visit the less likely it is that we will have to do anything “scary”!

We have a number of different teams within our agency that specialise in different areas of business so you can be sure that you won’t receive a generic service and although we can’t boast years and years of service we can ensure you that is a good thing in this industry. Our teams are up to date with the latest technologies, media trends and are keen to prove themselves in this industry and that’s what you want from an advertising agency, not someone who is relying on the same way of doing things that worked 10 years, 5 years or even a year ago.

Take a look at out Recent Work and Clients to see what we mean.
