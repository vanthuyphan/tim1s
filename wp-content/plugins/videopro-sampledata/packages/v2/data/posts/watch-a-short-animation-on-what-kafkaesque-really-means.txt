We are County Council Trading Standards Approved as part of the Buy With Confidence scheme and all of our vehicles are HPI checked. So you know that your car is genuinely available for sale, doesn’t have any outstanding finance on it and that we are a reputable dealer. We also verify the mileage on all of the cars that we are selling and ensure that they are all sold with long MOTs and road tax.

Welcome to our church. Whatever your faith or background our doors are open to you, both literally and virtually. Our beautiful church has services every day and is often open throughout the day for people to come and visit and sit in quiet reflection or to admire the stunning architecture of the building. You can also use our website to find out more about our work, what we have going on and details of people and organisations to contact if you need help or support with anything.
<blockquote>My designs have been sold all over Europe and the USA and I have worked with some of the biggest designers in the industry.</blockquote>

As well as in the church and on our website, you can also find us out and about in the community. We work in partnership with many schools, charities and community groups and also run a number of groups ourselves that we encourage others to get involved in.
