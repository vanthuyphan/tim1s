She played two of the most famous female leads in movie history. Born in New Jersey in 1924, Eva Marie Saint graduated from Bowling Green State University in 1946 and spent the first seven years of her acting career working in the Golden Age of television. She made the leap to the big screen in 1954 with an Oscar-winning performance as Edie Doyle in Elia Kazan's masterpiece On the Waterfront (1954). She certainly brought "real acting" to a time when melodrama still ran rampant in the industry.
