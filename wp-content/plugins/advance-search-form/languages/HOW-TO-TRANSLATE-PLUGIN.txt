1. Open en.po file in POEDIT (https://poedit.net/)

2. Translate all strings into your language

3. Save it. Name the file according to this format

asf-{language_code}.mo
videopro-{language_code}.mo

We need two files as this plugin supports 2 text domains. Change the language_code to your language. For example, language_code for German is de_DE, so the two files will be

asf-de_DE.mo
videopro-de_DE.mo

4. Put the .mo file in /languages/ folder of plugin
